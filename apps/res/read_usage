Usage: btoep-read [options]
Read all or some data from a dataset.

Options:
--help                     Display this information.
--version                  Display the version of this tool.
--dataset=<name>           Name (or path) of the dataset.
--index-path=<path>        Use this index file instead of the default one.
--lockfile-path=<path>     Use this lock file instead of the default one. This
                           is dangerous.
--offset=<offset>          Start reading at the given position within the file.
--length=<length>          Read exactly this many bytes, unless overridden by
                           --limit=<limit>. Fail if less bytes are available.
--limit=<limit>            Do not read more than this many bytes. Less bytes
                           might be read if less are available. This option has
                           no effect if --length=<length> is specified with
                           length <= limit.
